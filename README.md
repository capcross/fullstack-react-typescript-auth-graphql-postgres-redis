# fullstack-react-typescript-auth-graphql-postgres-redis

React + React Native + React Router + Formic + TypeScript + GraphQL + Apollo + PostgreSql + Redis + Monorepo (Lerna, Yarn Workspaces) + SignUp + SignIn + ForgetPassword fullstack boilerplate which is adapting to Windows dev environment.
This boilerplate is based on Ben Awad's brilliant "Fullstack Airbnb clone" (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlnfJIQBa6bBjjiECnk6zL6s) playlist.

Most of all we are going to use (PostgreSql and Redis are optional yet).
